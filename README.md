# Booking Demo

This project contains a minimal Spring Boot application demonstrating a simple booking website similar to booking.com. It supports viewing accommodations, booking dates, and login/logout using in-memory authentication.

## Running

```
mvn spring-boot:run -f booking/pom.xml
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` and log in with `user/password`.

The sample data is stored in memory only.
